# 📊 Digital Fatigue & Attention Economy Analytics  
(Behavioral Analytics & Forecasting Project)

## 🧠 Project Overview
A real-world, end-to-end **Advanced Data Analytics project** that models **user attention as a finite economic resource** and analyzes how digital platforms drive engagement, induce fatigue, and face monetization risk over time.

This project mirrors **industry-level product & behavioral analytics**, combining:
- Attention behavior analysis
- Custom metric & index design
- Fatigue risk modeling
- Monetization impact assessment
- Time-series forecasting
- Executive dashboarding

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Digital platforms aggressively compete for user attention, often leading to:
- Over-engagement and burnout
- Declining retention
- Long-term revenue instability

### Objectives:
- Measure **attention efficiency** instead of raw screen time  
- Quantify **digital fatigue risk**  
- Analyze how fatigue impacts **monetization sustainability**  
- Forecast future **attention saturation or decay**  
- Deliver actionable insights for product and business teams

## 🗂️ Dataset
**Synthetic, Assumption-Driven Attention Dataset**

This project uses a **realistic synthetic dataset** designed using:
- Industry reports
- Public behavioral patterns
- Platform engagement assumptions

### Key Dataset:
- `attention_platform_monthly.csv`

### Core Features:
- Average daily attention (minutes)
- Session duration & frequency
- Notification pressure
- Ad intensity
- Retention proxy
- Content refresh rate
- User age groups

> Synthetic data is used to demonstrate **methodology, analytical thinking, and business insight**, not exact platform performance.

## ⚙️ Methodology Overview

### Phase 1 – Data Design & Understanding
- Defined attention as an economic metric
- Designed platform-wise monthly engagement data
- Documented assumptions and limitations
- Created analysis-ready dataset

---

### Phase 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed attention consumption patterns
- Compared session depth vs frequency
- Studied notification and ad pressure
- Identified early fatigue signals across platforms

---

### Phase 3 – Attention Efficiency Modeling
- Designed **Attention Efficiency Score (AES)**
- Normalized engagement quality vs cognitive load
- Ranked platforms based on value per unit attention
- Identified inefficient attention consumption

---

### Phase 4 – Digital Fatigue Index (DFI)
- Built a composite fatigue risk index using:
  - Session pressure
  - Notification intensity
  - Ad load
  - Retention drop
- Classified platforms into:
  - Low Fatigue
  - Medium Fatigue
  - High Fatigue
- Generated fatigue heatmaps by age group

---

### Phase 5 – Monetization Risk Analysis
- Modeled revenue dependency on attention
- Estimated monetization sensitivity to fatigue
- Conducted scenario analysis (attention drop impact)
- Identified revenue-fragile platforms

---

### Phase 6 – Attention Decay Forecasting
- Modeled monthly attention trends
- Applied ARIMA-based forecasting
- Predicted 12-month attention trajectories
- Identified attention saturation and decay risk

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- High screen time does **not** imply high engagement quality  
- Notification overload is the strongest fatigue driver  
- Ad-heavy platforms are most monetization-sensitive  
- Digital fatigue is a **leading indicator** of revenue risk  
- Subscription models show higher resilience  
- Attention forecasting enables preventive product decisions  

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- Reduce notification and ad pressure for high-fatigue platforms  
- Optimize session depth over session frequency  
- Monitor fatigue metrics as early churn indicators  
- Use attention forecasting to guide UX and content strategy  
- Shift focus from attention capture to attention efficiency  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Time Series**: ARIMA (statsmodels)  
- **Analytics**: Custom metrics & indices  
- **Dashboarding**: Power BI  
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
